      <b>DOWNLOAD / INSTALL NECESSARY PROGRAMS</b> <br>

      4) Right-click on the <b>.rar</b> or <b>.zip</b> file. <br>
      5) Click "<b>Extract to Creator School GDPS\</b>" (for WinRAR, may be slightly different if you downloaded other software). <br>

			<h2><b><u>iOS Installation Instructions</u></b></h2>
      <p><b>METHODS</b> <br> <br>
      There are two different methods for installing the <b>.ipa</b> file onto your iOS device. <br>
      <br>
      <b>METHOD 1 - Using a PC, Mac or Linux</b> <br>
      <b>Cydia Impactor</b> is an excellent IPA installer available for Windows, Mac and Linux machines. Here are the steps you need to follow to install the <b>.ipa</b> on an iPhone / iPad without Jailbreak.<br>
      <br>
      1) Download <b>Cydia Impactor</b> from <a href="http://www.cydiaimpactor.com">cydiaimpactor.com</a> <br>
			2) After the download finishes, unzip the <b>.zip</b> file, open the folder and find <b>Impactor.exe</b>. Open it. <br>
			3) Now connect your iOS device to your computer with a USB cable (recommend the original or an official Apple cable). You also need <b>iTunes</b> installed for your device to show in <b>Cydia Impactor</b>. <br>
			4) Download the <b>.ipa</b> file using the button at the top of this page. <br>
			5) Drag and drop the <b>.ipa</b> file onto the <b>Cydia Impactor</b> UI. <br>
			6) Put in your <b>Apple ID</b> email and press <b>OK</b>. <br>
			7) Navigate (on a browser) to <a href="https://www.appleid.com">appleid.com</a> and login with your Apple / iTunes account. <br>
			8) Scroll down to the <b>Security</b> section. Find <b>APP-SPECIFIC PASSWORDS</b> and click <b>Generate Passwordâ€¦</b>. Name it whatever you want (may as well name it GDPS although it really doesn't matter), then copy the 16 character password that is generated in this form <b>xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx</b>. Copy this password, you won't be able to view it again after you leave the page or press <b>Done</b>. However you can generate another one whenever you like. <br>
			9) Return to <b>Cydia Impactor</b> and paste in the password you just generated. Press <b>OK</b>. The GDPS will now install on your device. <br>
			10) When it has finished installing you should see a Geometry Dash app icon on your home screen, if so you no longer need your PC, Mac or Linux. <br>
			11) (Now on your device) Head to <b>Settings > General > Profiles & Device Management</b>. Under <b>DEVELOPER APP</b> you should see the email you used just now. Click on it. Press <b>Trust "your_email_here"</b>, then <b>Trust</b> again. That's it! Now go ahead and play on your favourite GDPS! <br>
			<br>
			<b>METHOD 2 - Using diawi.com</b> <br>
			I recommend the first method but if you don't have a computer at hand you may have to try this method. NOTE: I have not tested this method and it may cost money. Therefore I will not provide instructions of what to do as I don't know myself. <br>

      <h2><b><u>Android Installation Instructions</u></b></h2>
      <p><b>PREPARE YOUR ANDROID DEVICE</b> <br> <br>
      Since your device considers any application outside of Google Play an "unknown app", you need to tell your device to allow you to install unknown apps. <br>
      <br>
      <b>ENABLE INSTALLING "UNKOWN APPS" ON ANDROID NOUGAT</b> <br>
      1) Go into <b>Settings</b>. <br>
      2) Tap <b>Security</b> (or <b>Lock Screen and Security</b>). <br>
      3) Scroll down to the <b>Device Administration</b> section, and enable <b>Unknown Sources</b>. <br> <br>
      <b>ENABLE INSTALLING "UNKOWN APPS" ON ANDROID OREO</b> <br>
      1) Go to <b>Settings</b>. <br>
      2) Then <b>Apps and Notifications</b>. <br>
      3) Select <b>Install Unknown Apps</b> (or <b>Install Other Apps</b>). <br> <br>
      <b>INSTALL AN ANDROID FILE MANAGER</b> <br>
      Now that you've configured your device to let you install unknown apps, you'll also need a way to find that application file (<b>APK file</b>) on your device so you can run it. <br>
      <br>
      Android devices typically come with a "File Manager" app you can use. But if you don't have one, then open Google Play on your device and search for "File Manager." You'll see lots of options available. <br>
      <br>
      Some of the best options include: <br>
      <br>
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en">
        ES File Explorer File Manager
      </a> <br>
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cxinventor.file.explorer">
        Cx File Explorer
      </a> <br>
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.effileexplorer.filemanager">
        EZ File Explorer
      </a> <br>
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alc.filemanager">
        File Manager
      </a> <br> <br>
      Install any of these file managers so you'll be able to locate the <b>APK file</b> after you've downloaded it to your device. <br>
      <br>
      <b>DOWNLOADING THE APK</b> <br>
      <br>
      1) Click the "<b>Android Download (.apk file)</b>" button at the top of this page to download the <b>APK file</b>. You may see a pop-up asking if you want to let your browser save files to your device's storage. Accept this. You'll also see a warning that says, "This type of file can harm your device." <br>
      2) Just click <b>OK</b> to continue. <br>
      3) If your device's web browser doesn't give you the option to open the file after downloading, then open the file explorer app you installed, and go to the Downloads folder on your device. <br>
      4) Tap the <b>APK file</b>. Allow the app any required permissions it asks for. Then, at the bottom of the installer window, click <b>INSTALL</b>. <br>
      5) You'll see a confirmation the app is installed. Now you'll see the app available in your list of installed apps. <br>
