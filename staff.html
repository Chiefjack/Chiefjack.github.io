				<p> <strong>Role: </strong>Owner</p>
				<p> <strong>About Me: </strong>Hey! I am the current Owner of the Discord server and have been for a few months, after StrikeKing22 stepped down to Co-Owner. I joined the server when it was made on the 17th February 2018, and helped the creator of the server, Veztix, setup the server. I have been in the Staff team since day 1, as a Co-Owner and now Owner. Currently I don't reallly play GD as I find it quite boring (2.2 when?). Feel free to message me if you have any questions :)</p>

				<p> <strong>Role: </strong>Co-Owner</p>
				<p> <strong>About Me: </strong>Hello, I am a current Co-Owner of the [OFFICAL] Creator School server on Discord. I resigned from my ownership and gave it to Chief a few months back and do everything I can to help the server grow. I am a design creator that has been playing since 2.0. Although I may have Creator Points, they are not something I build for, I focus on the detail and quality of my creations. You may not see me saying much in the server but I am usually the one to handle Teacher stuff and other things normal members cannot see.</p>

				<p> <strong>About Me: </strong>Hey! I am one of the moderators in the [OFFICIAL] Creator School! I have been playing Geometry Dash for about a year and a half but had some experience before playing the lite version. My favourite thing is to create. I like creating glow and design levels, I have for a couple of months. My style is mostly complex block design and simple air deco and space can be filled up with ground spikes. I'm also one of the Block Design Teachers! I'm more than happy to help anyone and answer any questions. Also pinging me or DMing doesn't hurt me at all, I'm more than happy if someone pings or DMs me!</p>

				<p> <strong>About Me: </strong> Hi, I'm MeG3oRite (pronounced mee - gee - yo - right [if that even make sense to you]) or you can call me meg for short. I make layouts usually but sometimes I also make a small decoration experimentation. I've been attempting to make decoration for a few years now and still not succeed so hope me good luck on it! I started playing Geometry Dash about 4 years ago when I was in grade 5 (I was in grade 8 now) but it takes me a lot of time to improve, and I'm still far from reaching to a phase where I can build a full level. Not usually interested in playing levels, more towards creating. (that's why I still have 3 demons on my profile) Ask me any questions you'd like to ask, don't hesitate.</p>

				<p> <strong>Role: </strong>Helper</p>
				<p> <strong>About Me: </strong>Hey, I'm Sakura. I am an Art/Modern creator and I am a Helper in the [OFFICIAL] Creator School! I've been playing GD for almost 5 years now, mostly on different accounts. I started as a Glow creator - which didn't work out for me well as at the time I was 9 - so I have been trying to master the styles of Art and Modern, while trying to combine the two. I am a Teacher for 3DL as well as a Tutor for Air Deco and 3DL, in the Discord server. I'm really slow at creating (hence why I haven't made a full level yet) but this allows me to look at the details and improve the level to the best it can be. If you have any questions about the lessons I teach or any questions regarding GD in general, feel free to ask me!</p>

				<p> <strong>About Me: </strong>Hi, I’m ZtratoZ, call me Z if you want to. I mostly create for fun, not for CP. My style is - what I call - hyper minimalism: an empty version of the general  modern style. I also expertise in atmosphere shaping in levels too. A couple months ago, I joined the Staff team with exceptionally surprising daily behavior and performance (in a good way, of course). I’ve gone through promotes and demotes, and I’d say I’m the most active among the server.</p>
